# orbit3d-octave
3D Earth Orbit simulation written in Octave

A red diamond indicates a delta-v being applied.

A red x indicates that the earth was impacted (or the more euphemistic: de-orbit occurred)

At the end of the simulation run, a few parameters are output to the command console.

To change delta-v configuration or other orbital parameters (such as start co-ordinates, velocity), edit the top part of the code file.
